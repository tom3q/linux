* ARM PrimeCell PL08x DMA Controllers

The ARM PrimeCell PL08x DMA controllers can move blocks of memory contents
between memory and peripherals or memory to memory.

Required properties:
  - compatible: should include two values:
    - one of following:
      - "arm,pl080" - for ARM PrimeCell PL080 DMA controller
      - "arm,pl081" - for ARM PrimeCell PL081 DMA controller
      - "arm,pl080s" - for Samsung-licensed ARM PL080s DMA controller
    - and also "arm,primecell".
  - reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
    region.
  - interrupt-parent: phandle of interrupt controller,
  - interrupts: interrupt specifier specific to interrupt controller,
  - #dma-cells: must be <1>. used to represent the number of integer
    cells in the dmas property of client device

Optional proparties:
  - clock-names: must contain one entry - "apb_pclk",
  - clocks: must contain one clock specifier of DMA bus clock

Example:

	dma0: dma@75000000 {
		compatible = "arm,pl080s", "arm,primecell";
		reg = <0x75000000 0x1000>;
		interrupt-parent = <&vic1>;
		interrupts = <9>;
		clocks = <&clocks HCLK_DMA0>;
		clock-names = "apb_pclk";
		#dma-cells = <1>;
	};

Device nodes of client devices should use simple DMA specifier format, which
consists of two values:
 - phandle of DMA controller,
 - index of DMA channel.

Example:

	spi0: spi@7f00b000 {
		/* ,,, */
		dma-names = "tx", "rx";
		dmas = <&dma0 12>, <&dma0 13>;
		/* ... (/
	};
